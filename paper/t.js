        abstract:' The steganography is a technique which hide the text data in the color and gray images .We can use different type of steganography techniques. Some Techniques are used in spatial Domain Technique. Some techniques are used in frequency Domain. Some steganography techniques are very popular like LSB, MSB and 7 bits in hiding the invisible information in various file formats images. In this paper, Steganography and Cryptography is combined for hiding and unhiding a text file into an image file. Data Compression is also used in this technique. LSB insertion technique is used for Steganography and LZ algorithm is used for Data Compression. Cryptography is done with RSA algorithm Keywords: LSB insertion technique, RSA Algorithm, LZ Algorithm, compression ,encryption'
